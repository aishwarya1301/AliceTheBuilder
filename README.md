# Game Instructions
Hey there, welcome to Alice the Builder gamebox! You and your opponent have to each build n towers comprising of f floors. Initially each of you are given a collection of f blocks in n different colors (a total of n*f blocks). You will play against your opponent in two stages,

Unsorted tower building phase: In this phase you and your opponent have to start building the tower block by block until both have exhausted your blocks.

--- Click on a block and then choose a tower to place it in
--- Double click on a tower to clear all the blocks in the tower
--- You are not allowed to stack more than two blocks of the same color together


Sort the tower phase: In the second phase, you have to sort the towers one block in each turn with the help of two empty towers. Your aim is to finish sorting all the blocks that you started with, into homogenous towers (consisting of only blocks of the original color assigned to you) within a given number of moves.

--- Select the tower you want to move a block from first, followed by the tower you want to move it to and submit your move.


The first player who constructs maximum number of tallest homogenous towers (with colors assigned to them) in least number of moves WINS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
